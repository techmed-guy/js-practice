    <h1>ASYNC AND AWAIT</h1>
    <p>when we use async in front of a function we do not need to call/ instantiate any promise.</p>
    <p>await in this case serves as the callback or let's say a command that tells the promise to pause its operation
        until a task is completed and we tell it what to do when that task is completed by using "return ...(TASK HERE)"
    </p>
